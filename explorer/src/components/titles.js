HashEvents are events produced by the contributors to the HashGraph. They contain messages produced by the contributors, and information about who has seen the message, and when the messages were received by other contributors. HashEvents are updated with new information when available. Each event has an unique id for identification. HashEvents also contain meta information about whichc contributors have and have not seen this event. When an event has been seen by all the contributors, this is called "consensus". When this happens the final order of the event can be calculated, as long as all the previous events have also reached consensus.`;
